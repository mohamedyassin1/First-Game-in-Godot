This project was made by following the tutorial: [How to make a Video Game - Godot Beginner Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOhfqjmasi0) from Brackeys. I used Godot version 4.3 while following the tutorial.

Using the above tutorial as a reference for my own project, but storing the project on GitHub in case I lose the files in the future.
