This project was originally made by following the tutorial: [How to make a Video Game - Godot Beginner Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOhfqjmasi0) from Brackeys. I used Godot version 4.3 while following the tutorial.

To get more comfortable with game development in Godot, I decided to build this project further. So far, I've added:
- Ability for the player to double jump
- Ability for the player to roll
	- The player can also avoid enemy hits by rolling
		
The game is on github pages so that you can try it: https://mohamedyassin1.github.io/platformer-playable/
